# Project Title
MyToken - ERC-20 Token

#Simple Overview
This project demonstrates the creation and deployment of a basic ERC-20 token called "MyToken" on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract allows the owner to mint tokens, any user to burn tokens, and facilitates token transfers.

# Description
The ERC-20 token, implemented in Solidity, includes standard functionalities such as minting, burning, and transferring. The contract is named "MyToken" with the symbol "MTK" and is initialized with an initial supply of 1,000,000 tokens. The owner of the contract is granted the ability to mint new tokens, while any user can burn their own tokens or transfer them to others.

# Getting Started
